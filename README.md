# Machine Learning for Trading

### Course summary

This course presents students with real world challenges in implementing machine learning strategies based on machine learning, including the steps of information gathering algorithms to market orders. The focus is on how to apply probabilistic machine learning approaches to business decisions. We consider statistical approaches such as linear regression, KNN and regression trees and how to apply them to real stock trading situations.

### FINAL PROJECT

In this final project, you will take advantage of what you have learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice through the application of algorithms and machine learning techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate possible performance metrics and solutions. You will then analyze the problem through visualizations and data mining to gain a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.

You will then implement your chosen algorithms and metrics, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and post-processing steps along the way. Then you will collect the results on the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate / justify these values. Finally, you will build conclusions about your results, and discuss whether implementation properly resolves the problem.
